      "## Numerical Solutions to PDEs\n",
      "This is a field that has a vast amount of research done in it and it is insulting to attempt to summarize it here. Unfortunately, I am a rude person, so I will attempt to do exactly that.\n",

      "### The Finite Difference Method\n",
      "The basis of solving PDEs numerically is the idea of discretizing the derivatives and then iterating these discretizations through time (so time is also discretized!). Consider a simple first derivative:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall that we can calculate the derivative from first principles as such\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{u(x+h) - u(x)}{h}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The discretization of a derivative is based off of this concept. Suppose we had an interval $x\\in [a,b]$. For some integer $M$, let us split up this interval into $M+1$ partitions and label the end-points as $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, $i=0,\\dots,M$. Then, the entire interval has $M+2$ points: a left-most point $x_0$, a right-most point $x_{M+1}$, and $M$ inner points $x_1, \\dots, x_M$. Let us also define\n",

      "so that an approximation to the derivative of $U$ can be expressed as\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{dU_i}{dx} = \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_i }{\\Delta x}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\Delta x \\equiv \\frac{x_{M+1} - x_0}{N+1}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, $U_{i+1}$ can be thought of as $u(x+h)$. If we were to take $M\\to\\infty$, then this would no longer be an approximation. This method is called the **finite difference method**.\n",

      "It can be shown (not here) that the second derivative can be written as\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We can approximate the derivative like so:\n",

      "$$ f(t,y(t)) = \\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta t}$$\n",

      "### The Heat Equation\n",
      "Although this equation can be solved analytically, consider the 1D Heat Equation:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "First discretizing the equation in space gives us\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta x^2} (U_{i+1} - 2U_i + U_{i-1} ) $$\n",
      "\n",

      "So, we know the initial solution to our problem $(t = t_0)$. To find the solution for all points in time, we must step our initial solution through time. For example, calculating the solution at $t = t_1$:\n",

      "Solving the heat equation numerically is simple enough, but doing it by hand would be quite awful and many mistakes would be made (the first mistake being the decision to do it by hand in the first place). Let's write a program to do it for us. The first thing we need to do is install Python's numerical and plotting libraries. In a terminal, run\n",
