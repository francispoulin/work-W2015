      "## Numerical Solutions to PDEs\n",
      "This is a field that has a vast amount of research done in it and it is insulting to attempt to summarize it here. Unfortunately, I am a rude person, so I will attempt to do exactly that.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Finite Difference Method\n",
      "The basis of solving PDEs numerically is the idea of discretizing the derivatives and then iterating these discretizations through time (so time is also discretized!). Consider a simple first derivative:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall that we can calculate the derivative from first principles as such\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{u(x+h) - u(x)}{h}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The discretization of a derivative is based off of this concept. Suppose we had an interval $x\\in [a,b]$. For some integer $M$, let us split up this interval into $M+1$ partitions and label the end-points as $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$, $i=0,\\dots,M$. Then, the entire interval has $M+2$ points: a left-most point $x_0$, a right-most point $x_{M+1}$, and $M$ inner points $x_1, \\dots, x_M$. Let us also define\n",
      "\n",
      "$$U_i \\equiv u(x_i) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "so that an approximation to the derivative of $U$ can be expressed as\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{dU_i}{dx} = \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_i }{\\Delta x}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\Delta x \\equiv \\frac{x_{M+1} - x_0}{N+1}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, $U_{i+1}$ can be thought of as $u(x+h)$. If we were to take $M\\to\\infty$, then this would no longer be an approximation. This method is called the **finite difference method**.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be shown (not here) that the second derivative can be written as\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\frac{d^2U_i}{dx^2} = \\frac{U_{i+1} - 2U_i + U_{i-1} }{\\Delta x^2}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Forward Euler Method\n",
      "The Forward Euler Method is a method used on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is quite similar to the finite difference method. Consider the problem\n",

      "$$ y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \\qquad \\qquad y(t_0)=y_0 $$\n",
      "\n",
      "For some interval $t\\in [t_0, t_f]$. For some integer $N$, let us split this interval into $N-1$ partitions so we have $N$ points: a left-most point $t_0$ and a right-most point $t_{N-1} = t_f$.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can approximate the derivative like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ y_n'(t) = \\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta t} $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $$\\Delta t \\equiv \\frac{t_f - t_0}{N}$$ Then\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ f(t,y(t)) = \\frac{y_{n+1} - y_n}{\\Delta t}$$\n",
      "\n",

      "### The Heat Equation\n",
      "Although this equation can be solved analytically, consider the 1D Heat Equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming $x\\in [0,L]$ and $t\\in[0,T]$, we will use the following initial condition and boundary conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ u(x,0) = f(x) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ u(0,t) = \\alpha, \\quad u(L,t) = \\beta $$\n",
      "\n",
      "Physically, this set of equations can be thought of as a metal wire whose heat is distributed according to $f(x)$, while the left end of the rod is constantly being set to the temperature $\\alpha$ and the right end of the rod is constantly being set to the temperature $\\beta$.\n",
      "\n",
      "First discretizing the equation in space gives us\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta x^2} (U_{i+1} - 2U_i + U_{i-1} ) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $i=1,\\dots,M$. The same \"set up\" (number of spatial and temporal intervals and points) is used. Now, if we discretize in time, we get\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ \\frac{U^{n+1}_i - U^n_i}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta x^2} (U^n_{i+1} - 2U^n_i + U^n_{i-1}) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $n=0,\\dots,N$. Note that $U^n_i = U(x_i, t_n)$. We can rearrange this equation to get\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^{n+1}_i = U^n_i + K (U^n_{i+1} - 2U^n_i + U^n_{i-1} ) $$\n",
      "\n",
      "where $K = \\frac{\\kappa \\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2} $. Further simplification yields\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^{n+1}_i = (1 - 2K)U^n_i + K (U^n_{i+1} + U^n_{i-1} ) $$ \n",
      "\n",
      "(An alteration to this, for the sake of optimization, is to define a constant to be $1 - 2K$ to reduce the number of FLOPs).\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be wondering how the initial/boundary conditions come into play. We must discretize them as well, so to speak:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^0_i = f(x_i) \\quad i=1,\\dots,M $$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^n_0 = \\alpha \\quad \\forall n $$\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^n_{m+1} = \\beta \\quad \\forall n $$\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we know the initial solution to our problem $(t = t_0)$. To find the solution for all points in time, we must step our initial solution through time. For example, calculating the solution at $t = t_1$:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ U^1_0 = \\alpha $$\n",
      "\n",

      "### Implementation of Solving the 1D Heat Equation Numerically\n",
      "Solving the heat equation numerically is simple enough, but doing it by hand would be quite awful and many mistakes would be made (the first mistake being the decision to do it by hand in the first place). Let's write a program to do it for us. Before we begin, let's install Python's numerical and plotting libraries. In a terminal, run\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "To make sure these libraries installed correctly, run an interactive Python shell by running `python` in the terminal, and then attempting to import `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` respectively. If you're not familiar with how Numpy works, see the section on Numpy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll first implement a pure Python solver, which will run slowly, but it will work! We will be solving the 1D heat equation with the following conditions:\n",
